# slim-whatsapp-web.js
This is a fork of Whatsapp Web JS package by pedroslopez
Made with the intent to be a stripped-down version of the souce package,
allowing only basic whatsapp functionality as sending and replying to messages. 

**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.
